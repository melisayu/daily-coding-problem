## How to test
You can test the solutions one by one by going to one of the problems directory.
Make sure you have mochajs installed.

If you don't have mochajs installed, you can use the following command to install it globally:
```shell
npm install --global mocha
```

If you have mochajs installed you can just go to the problem directory where you can see **solution.js** and **test.js** files and run this command to test the solution:
```shell
npm test
```
